# Summary:

# I learned a lot and gained real-world experience in software development and quality assurance from this assignment. Understanding how to use and navigate a REST API's endpoints, authentication procedures, and data flow was one of the main lessons learned. The practical application of test cases strengthened this fundamental comprehension and increased my understanding of how testing contributes to robustness and dependability. Trying to raise the test coverage to 90% forced me to consider scenarios and edge cases more carefully, which helped me gain a more thorough grasp of how to create safe, tested software.
