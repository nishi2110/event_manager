**Reflection on what you learned from this assignment:**
This assignment was a valuable learning experience, offering insights into how code coordination is managed in the IT industry. I gained a deeper understanding of the processes involved in maintaining a codebase, ensuring that changes made by different contributors align seamlessly. Coordinating updates, resolving conflicts, and maintaining a shared vision for the project helped me appreciate the importance of structured workflows in software development.

One of the most eye-opening aspects was learning how the end-to-end code merge flow operates. From creating branches to making commits, raising pull requests, and handling reviews, I experienced the entire lifecycle of a code change. Understanding how changes are merged into the main branch, while ensuring minimal disruption to the existing functionality, was both challenging and rewarding. It also underscored the importance of following version control best practices and using tools like Git to maintain a clean and trackable code history.

I also developed a clearer understanding of how testing fits into the development process. Writing pytests not only helped ensure that new code worked as intended but also demonstrated the importance of creating test cases to validate existing functionality. Testing proved to be a crucial step in catching potential errors early and building confidence in the quality of the code before deployment.

Furthermore, this process introduced me to the deployment pipeline, where changes are integrated and pushed to live environments. I learned how deployment automation tools play a critical role in ensuring that the transition from development to production is smooth and error-free. This gave me a practical perspective on how code, once written and tested, is deployed for real-world use.

In brief, I gained a well-rounded perspective on software development, from writing and testing code to coordinating with a team and deploying a project. This hands-on experience has been instrumental in preparing me for real-world IT workflows and challenges.
