## Specific Issues to Address

In this assignment, you will identify, document, and resolve five specific issues related to:

1. **Username validation**: Investigate and resolve any issues related to username validation. This may involve handling special characters, enforcing length constraints, or ensuring uniqueness. Proper username validation is essential to maintain data integrity and prevent potential security vulnerabilities.

2. **Password validation**: Ensure that password validation follows security best practices, such as enforcing minimum length, requiring complexity (e.g., a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters), and properly hashing passwords before storing them in the database. Robust password validation protects user accounts and mitigates the risk of unauthorized access.

3. **Profile field edge cases**: Test and handle various scenarios related to updating profile fields. This may include updating the bio and profile picture URL simultaneously or individually. Consider different combinations of fields being updated and ensure that the API handles these cases gracefully. Edge case testing helps uncover potential issues and ensures a smooth user experience.

Additionally, you will resolve a sixth issue demonstrated in the instructor video. These issues will test various combinations and scenarios to simulate real-world usage and potential edge cases. By addressing these specific issues, you will gain experience in identifying and resolving common challenges in API development.

## Submission Requirements

To complete this assignment, submit the following:

1. **GitHub Repository Link**: Ensure that your repository is well-organized and includes:
  - Links to five closed issues, each with accompanying test code and necessary application code modifications.
  - Each issue should be well-documented, explaining the problem, the steps taken to resolve it, and the outcome. Proper documentation helps others understand your work and facilitates future maintenance.
  - All issues should be merged into the main branch, following the Git workflow and best practices.

2. **Updated README**: Replace the existing README with:
  - Links to the closed issues, providing easy access to your work.
  - Link to project image deployed to Dockerhub.
  - A 2-3 paragraph reflection on what you learned from this assignment, focusing on both technical skills and collaborative processes. Reflect on the challenges you faced, the solutions you implemented, and the insights you gained. This reflection helps solidify your learning and provides valuable feedback for improving the assignment in the future.
