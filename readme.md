### Reflection

In this assignment, I gained hands-on experience with developing and securing REST APIs using FastAPI. The tasks helped me understand the importance of proper validation for user inputs and handling edge cases in profile updates. Collaborating using Git and GitHub emphasized the importance of version control and code reviews in a development workflow. Writing comprehensive tests ensured the reliability of the application and improved my skills in testing APIs.
